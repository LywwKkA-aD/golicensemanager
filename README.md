## 🎬 The Plot (What's This All About?)

GoLicenseManager is your friendly neighborhood license manager that helps you:

- Keep track of who's using what (like a really organized party host)
- Make sure everyone paid their dues (we're looking at you, Dave 👀)
- Handle multiple applications (because juggling is fun!)
- Manage clients (the ones who pay the bills)

## 🎥 Behind the Scenes (The Technical Stuff)

### 🎬 The Main Character (cmd/golicensemanager/main.go)

```go
// This is where our hero begins their journey
func main() {
    // Epic journey starts here
    // Details in cmd/golicensemanager/main.go
}
```

### 🎭 The Supporting Cast (Key Components)

#### 1. Models (The Character Sheets)

Located in `internal/models/models.go`, we have:

- `Application`: The software that needs licensing (thinks it's the main character)
- `LicenseType`: Different flavors of licenses (like ice cream, but for software)
- `License`: The actual permit (the MacGuffin of our story)
- `Client`: The people who need licenses (the real heroes)

#### 2. Database Schema (The World Building)

```sql
-- This is where we keep all our secrets
CREATE TABLE applications (...)  -- Home of the cool kids
CREATE TABLE licenses (...)      -- Where the magic happens
CREATE TABLE clients (...)       -- Our VIP list
```

#### 3. Services (The Plot Drivers)

Each service is like a different episode in our series:

- `ApplicationService`: The pilot episode
- `LicenseService`: The season finale
- `ClientService`: The fan favorite

#### 4. Handlers (The Action Scenes)

All the exciting stuff happens here:

```go
// ApplicationHandler - The protagonist
func (h *ApplicationHandler) Create(c *gin.Context) {
    // Creating applications like a boss
}

// LicenseHandler - The plot twist master
func (h *LicenseHandler) Validate(c *gin.Context) {
    // Validating licenses like a customs officer
}
```
